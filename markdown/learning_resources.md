### [Programming Elixir 1.6 by Dave Thomas](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/)

> This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, completely updated for Elixir 1.6 and beyond. Explore functional programming without the academic overtones (tell me about monads just one more time). Create concurrent applications, but get them right without all the locking and consistency headaches. Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir’s pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it’s Elixir.

> In this blog post, we’ll be talking about what exactly the repository pattern is, how it applies to Ecto, and how you can go about testing your Ecto backed applications without using a database. We’ll play around with this concept by putting together a simple Elixir application that leverages Postgres during development. But, then we will write some tests that make use of a database-less mock Repo. Without further ado, let’s dive right into things!
